# Continuity Camera Mount

This is a holder for using continuity camera on a monitor. You can stick it to the backside of your monitor using double sided adhesive tape. The curvature of the curved version matches the backside curvature of many LG Monitors.

It has two steps: one for using the camera and one for storing the phone out of sight.

You can load the FCStd file in FreeCAD and change the parameters in the spreadsheet to create your own version with a different curvature, phone thickness etc.

These are the parameters you can edit:

- WT: Wall Thickness
- PT: Phone Thickness
- SD: Step Difference
- CSWH: Camera Side Wall Height
- DSWH Display Side Wall Height
- W: Width
- CR: Curve Radius
