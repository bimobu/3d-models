# Power Suppy Unit (PSU) Holder

I use this to stick my PSU to the underside of my desk with double sided adhesive tape.

The names of the stl files in the STL directory refer to the parameters used to create the given model:

L: The length on the inside of the holder (the width of the PSU)
H: The height of the PSU
W: The extrusion/pad distance
GL: Grip length, only relevant for the (deprecated) open version
WT: The thickness of the walls
BH: Base height. This is the thickness of the surface that gets stuck to the desk.
